Dear employer,  
I put codes and references to this github to demonstrate my genuine passion in quantitative financial modeling.  
I am particularly interested in financial mathematics, stochastic processes, derivative structuring and pricing, statistical analysis etc.  
It is known that many job-specific skills can only be obtained through related work experience, therefore I wish to hone my quick learning ability in quantitative work and willingness to work in the financial industry.  
Hope to meet soon and explain myself more.  

Best regards,  
Sean
